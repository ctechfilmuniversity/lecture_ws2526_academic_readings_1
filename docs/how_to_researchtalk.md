# Getting Started

---

## Getting Started

What type of talk are you giving to whom?

--

* Summary vs. proposal
* One topic vs. many topics
* Deep vs. overview
* Intellectual vs. intuitive
* Experts vs. casual listeners

--

Which audience response do you want?

--

* Emotional vs. knowledge

---

> emotions do!

## Getting Started

> Know with what and whom you are dealing with!
  
 
--
  
Today's scenario:

* Research talk based on a already reviewed and accepted paper
    * Complex topic, neutral tone
* Many aspects are generalizable

--

> Telling a story about the given content.

---
.header[Getting Started]

## Timing

--

* Know the time that you have

#**Deliver the given time!**

---
.header[Getting Started]

## Timing

* Know the time that you have
* Deliver the given time!

--
* Talking too long is a deadly sin

--
    * Chance of being cut of
    * Everyone will remember that and not your talk
--
* Talking too short reflects bad on your work

--

> Being off time is usually due to missing preparation and practice.

---
.header[Getting Started]

## Timing üò±

> How am I going to tell everything in only 20 minutes?

--

That is your main task to solve!

---
.header[Getting Started | Timing]

## Developing Content

* Leave stuff out. Don‚Äôt get lost in the details‚Ä¶

---
.header[Getting Started | Timing]

## Developing Content

--

* Tell a story

--
    * Everything else needs to follow the storyline  
--
    * If something doesn't add to or integrate, out with it 
--
* Create a take-home message

--
    * What is in it for the audience?
???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* I usually start with developing a take-home message
--
    * This is difficult

???
* Example: Motivate Your Audience

.center[<img src="./img/researchtalk.081.png" alt="researchtalk" style="width:80%;">]

---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## Motivate Your Audience

* Don‚Äôt start in a boring way
    * Drop the index slide up front
--
* Show me something that catches my attention
    * Start showing a (cool) result
    * Think of it as of a movie trailer

---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## The Details

> A bit of a downhill slide‚Ä¶

--

* You‚Äôre going to lose parts of the audience
    * It‚Äôs unavoidable

--
*On a side note*:
  
* Be positive (and brief) when discussing related work
    * Use it only to contextualize your work
    * What gap is your work addressing?

---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## The Details

* Add complexity (e.g., theories, equations, algorithms, diagrams) in a sensible way

--
    * Walk your audience through them
    * Can you use animations?	
    * Break the scenario into simpler chunks

---

.center[<img src="./img/researchtalk_anim.gif" alt="thirds_07" style="width:80%;">]


---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## The Details

* You will not be able to explain all the details
    * Reference people to your paper / proposal
--
* Structure the information in layers
    * Add details for a few chosen ones
    * But don‚Äôt lose the rest for too long

--

> Build recovery points; summarize; give your audience breaks...

---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## Results

* It‚Äôs OK to use the same results from the beginning

--
* And then some more of course!
    * Show many, many results
    * Show a range - what worked well, what didn‚Äôt
    * Refer to abnormalities, etc.
--
    * ‚Ä¶but try to leave your audience wanting more
--
* Don‚Äôt end with (sad) limitations  

--
* End on a positive note


---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## Ending The Talk‚Ä¶

* Reconsider a ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuestions?‚Äù slide in the end
    * It‚Äôs boring‚Ä¶ and this is what will stare at the longest during Q&A


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* But do thank your audience!

--
* Take-home message
* Summary of the work
* Website for additional info
* Cool results

## Structuring

--
* Develop a structure

--
    * The structure and layout of the reference, e.g., your paper, is not necessarily the best layout for the presentation
--
* Communicate the structure to your audience

---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## Communicate the Structure

* Introduction
* Previous work

    * Part A
    * Part B
    * Part C

* Conclusions
* Future Work

---
.header[Anatomy of a Talk]

## Communicate the Structure

* Use visual guides, e.g. in the heading

--
* Use a pipeline / process image to guide through the talk

--
* Use the structure to build recovery points
    * Summarize aspects covered so far
    * Show where we are in the story

* We consider two-tone texture models that blend between two colors with a convex interpolation based on a structure function and this function depends on several structural parameters. We do not make and further restrictions on the design of texture model.

.task[COMMENT:]  

* By using two-tone texture models we assume that the input picture shows a two-tone texture also.  This implies that the distribution of its color values in the RGB cube follows a straight line.  A principal component analysis (PCA) of the color values reveals the line's location as the first principal component (the one corresponding to the eigenvector of the covariance matrix with the largest eigenvalue). The extremal pixel values of the input picture define its two constituent tones An affine transformation maps the color with the smaller luminance value to 0 and the greater one to 1. I f the luminance comparison fails, we use the three channels in lexicographical order for comparison. This mapping transforms the input picture to a gray valued structural image s_target and we can proceed with matching this structural information. The determined tones c_1 and c_2 constitute the final colors for the texture program. For input images that deviate from the two-tone assumption, the pixel values are projected onto the straight line c_1 c_2. As the projected values may fall outside the RGB unit cube, we chose the intersection points of the line with the RGB cube as the two constituent colors.

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* As we follow a generalized approach with a variety of possible input images and texture models we are looking to define image similarity or rather distance based on appearance not pixel values. In order to achieve interactive performance, we want to allow for fast numerical search, derived from being compactly storable, which we can do by abstracting the texture input sufficiently while maintaining features that are relevant for a human observer. Global statistics: overall brightness and contrast Frequencies and their distributions: corresponding to structural orientations We formulate a metric incorporating both types into a descriptor vector which can be independently computed per input image and compactly stored

## Visual Layout

* I will dive straight into the problem, assuming you know as much as I do about the topic in general and the specific problems I‚Äôm trying to solve in particular
* I will throw my solutions at you without a warning, without any motivation, or any insight about the key observations that lead to the proposed solution
* I will also write Every. Single. Word. I will articulate, thus limiting myself to simply reading the slides, while filling the space with lots and lots of words that you may or may not read but hey words are free right? So why not keep typing until I simply run out of space and then I‚Äôll just add a new slide and continue
* My solution could make the world a better place but no-one will know about my ideas because I gave such a bad presentation that made everybody dislike the topic.
