## Purpose of the Course

In this course the participants practice to read publications of the arts and humanities. Participants evaluate each publication through the discussions with the group.

This course is offered in combination with ‘Academic Readings II’, which covers publications from computer science. Both courses can be attended in interchangeable order.


## Learning Objectives

* Read and understand research publications
* Judge the content of a publication in terms of relevance and soundness
* Summarize and present a publication
* Text skimming while still grasping its content


## Method of Instruction

### Readings

* You chose one reading, which is typically a book (either from the list below or of your own choice)
    * You must send me a list of your top two choices of readings by **October 29**
    * I will let you know about your assigned reading and the presentation schedule by November 3rd
* From the reading itself you must chose an excerpt of about 30-60 pages, depending on the complexity of the text; Usually choosing the first chapter(s) of a book is a good idea.


### Presentation

* You are responsible to carefully read the text, understand it as good as you can and present it with a 20-25 minutes to your fellow students
    * You might want to include interesting background information and further contexts
    * Next to the presentation of the given content, you must briefly discuss  **your judgement of the reading** and **how the content is relevant to CTech**.
    * The overall goal of the presentation is to foster a discussion about the text and the discussion is to be moderated by you; You must prepare at least **three questions for the discussion** (it is up to you when to use them). 
* At the latest one week before the presentation you must let me know, which pages you are going to cover
* After the presentation you are required to upload your slides to this GitHub repository (into the folder `presentations`)

### Participation

* I highly recommend that you go over all texts in advance (meaning not only your reading) and grasp their overall ideas
* All students are required to participate in the discussions after the presentation


## Readings

The following list offers you some readings to chose from. You can also propose a book that is not on the list. Also, if you are interested in a particular topic, which is not included here, get in touch with me and we will try to find a suitable reading together. All chosen readings must be of a certain quality and need to fit to the overall *Creative Technologies* context and to *Arts & Humanities*. All text must be approved by me. 

You can find most pdfs of the following list in this [ownCloud repository](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/kAb4bsTCPkHBSPa) (pw: ar1) with the filename `firstauthorlastname_year_firstlettersofthefirstthreewords.pdf`. If would like to chose a reading from the above list for which there is no pdf, please get in touch as soon as possible. Then I will still need to scan the text. For a new reading that is not on the list, you are responsible to scan the book and provide a digital version of the text to the others.

## Evaluation

The requirements to pass the course are 

* the presentation of the assigned reading,
* the discussion lead regarding the reading and related topics,
* active participation in the discussions in all sessions.

Attendance is mandatory. If more than 2 sessions are missed, the course is failed. In case of illness or other justifiable reasons of absence, sent a notification before the class to a.walmsley@filmuniversitaet.de and your absence might be excused.

If you completed your presentation but fail due to too many missed classes, you can re-do the class by attending 5 session of AR1 in the following year. You do not have to give a presentation again.

### Grading

There will be a grade for this class. 

The grade is based on

* your presentation (70% of the grade), and
* your participation in the discussions (30%).

The presentation grade is based on

* how well the topic of the reading is understood and communicated,
* the difficulty and quantity of the considered texts,
* the quality of the discussion of the reading's relevance for Creative Technologies,
* the quality and quantity of given contexts and background information,
* how well the discussion is lead in terms of input questions and moderation, and
* the creativity of the presentation and/or discussion lead.

## Inclusivity Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.  

It is my intent to present activities that accommodate and value a diversity of gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. I will gladly honor your request to address you by your preferred name and gender pronoun. I commit to make individual arrangements to address disabilities or religious needs (e.g. religious events in conflict with class meetings and deadlines). Please advise me of these preferences and needs early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my plans and records.  

Debate and free exchange of ideas is encouraged, but I will not tolerate harassment, i.e. a pattern of behavior directed against a particular individual with the intent of humiliating or intimidating.

## Stress Culture

Take care of yourself. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available at Filmuni, and an important part of the university experience is learning how to ask for help. If you or anyone you know experiences any unbearable academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. The Filmuni offers different [services and counseling](https://www.filmuniversitaet.de/en/university/counseling-services) for you.
